/// Single commit prompt - handles all commit scenarios
pub const COMMIT_PROMPT: &str =
"You are operating in a command line interface, performing automated commit generation for a Git repository.

Your task:

1. **Analyze changes in the current Git repository.**
   - If there are staged files, only consider those.
   - If there are no staged files, consider all unstaged changes instead.
   - Use `git diff --cached` for staged changes, or `git diff` for unstaged changes.
   - Group related changes into small, logical commits that follow best practices for incremental commits.

2. **Generate commit messages following the Conventional Commits standard.**
   - Use the format: `<type>(<optional scope>): <short description>`
   - Keep each message concise and clear.
   - Limit the body to **at most two bullet points**, summarizing what and why the change was made.
   - Subject line under **72 characters**, written in **present tense**.
   - Focus on **what changed** and **why**, not how.

3. **Respect existing repository or app-level rules.**
   - If the repository or `cursor-agent` configuration defines custom commit rules or LLM behavior rules, those take **precedence** over this prompt.
   - Harmonize your output with any detected `.cursor-agent`, `.aiconfig`, or other LLM configuration files.

4. **Commit grouping guidance.**
   - Suggest logical groupings of files or changes to be committed together.
   - Recommend separate commits for distinct change types (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`).
   - Once you've created your recommended list of commits, execute them using `git commit`.

**Output Format Example:**
feat(api): add JWT authentication middleware
- implement token validation and route protection
- update user endpoints to require authentication

fix(ui): correct navbar alignment on mobile
- adjust CSS grid for better responsiveness
